你好.

这里是一名北欧建筑与城市规划留学生的博客，他曾在斯德哥尔摩学习一年，现居赫尔辛基。北欧的生活平缓而舒适，他可以望着窗外簌簌作响的杉树枝度过许久的时光，也可以在喜欢的书本和工作上感受时光的匆匆。他喜欢体验式旅游，胶片摄影和日本文学。他不喜欢吃牛蛙以及爬行类动物，不喜欢恐怖片，讨厌突然打断生活的安排。他决定开始记录生活。


Hello,

Here is a blog of a master student in architecture and urban design. He studied in Stockholm for one year and now he is studying for his second year in Helsinki. The life pace in Nordic is slow and comfortable, while he can enjoy watching the leaves fall down or reading a book when time flies. He likes travel,photograph and Japanese literature. He doesn't like bullfrog and reptiles as food, hates horror film and the schedule which suddenly happens. He makes the decision to write about the life.
